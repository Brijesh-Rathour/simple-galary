Simple Gallery & Slideshow:
This project provides a simple implementation of a gallery and slideshow using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view images in a gallery format and automatically cycles through a slideshow of images.

Features:
- Clicking on an image in the gallery opens a lightbox overlay to display the image in a larger size.
- The slideshow automatically changes images every 3 seconds.

  
To add more images to the gallery or slideshow, simply update the slideshowImages array in the script.js file or ht.html file with the URLs of the new images.
